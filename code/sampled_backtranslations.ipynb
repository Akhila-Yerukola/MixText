      "do i have to have a religion?   if you don't believe you don't believe.  it is ok.  why should you believe in somehting of which there is no proof?    in my personal opinion, there are only three reasons people become religious:  1)  they are fearful.  fearful of death, fearful of not knowing the purpose of their existence, fearful of losing everything that they value in this life (which you will, gauranteed).  fear is a powerful motivator and when someone offers you a way to manage that fear through a belief system it can be tempting to accept.  there is no need to resort to philosophy, science or psyhcology.  there is no need to accept that there are rational and scientific explanations that we as humans simply don't know yet.   just believe that someone's making it all right in the end and you're all set.  2) they are seeking a path to redemption for past sins.  they are having difficulty coping with the consequences of some bad action they have taken in thier life, and or are trying to control some compulsive behavior that has caused hardship in their life.  either they were in prison, got caught with a prostitue, or drank themselves out of job and their family, or simply told a horrible lie that they feel guilty about.  religion offers instant redemption and rituals to help you ease your mind through repentance.    3)  they have a strong natural desire for community and companionship.  having someplace to go every sunday with likeminded people or having rituals to follow when someone dies, or having a language or framework to use when communicating your values with others can be very comforting.  if your family already subscribes to these beliefs you even may feel pressure to accept things that your logical mind tells you are impossible and&#92;or unlikely.  you can deal with these three situations through patience, meditation, compassion, seeking help from others, and community activism, or you can choose to believe in supernatural beings and mythology.  my personal opinion is that there is no easy way out of any problem so that when a christian says i can instantly have my sins forgiven or a scientologist tells me that body thetans are causing my suffering, or some guru tells me that my shakras just need alignments, i usually take a pass.\n",

      "how season ocurr?/what factors affecting them?   the above is an incorrect answer. seasons do not occur because of the distance of the earth to the sun. in fact, during winter, the earth is physically closer to the sun and during the summer, it is furthest.  tilt is key. its important that not only is there a tilt on the earth, but the direction of that tilt is not altered during the rotation of the earth around the sun.  the northern hemisphere is always tilting away during the winter, and towards the sun during the summer. the tilt of the earth is 23 degrees. so lets say you're at 45 degrees lattitude. during the summer, the sun will rise to 45+23 (68) degrees because the tilt is towards it, and in winter, the sun only goes to 45-23 (22) degrees. there is a big difference between the sun going up 22 degrees and the sun going to 68 degrees.  when the sun goes to 68 degrees, it is more overhead, and the earth therefore receives more of its rays. during winter, light rays are striking obliquely, and hence do not warm the earth as much.  this is why there are less variations of seasons around the equator, where the sun is almost always directly overhead all the time.  and this is why seasons are reversed on the southern hemisphere. when the northern hemisphere tilts towards the sun, the south is tilting away.\n",

      "the above is a wrong report. seasons do not result from the difference between the local and sun. in winter the earth stands on the sun physically and is further afield during summer. the schwierigen angle of the earth has to be chosen 枚, so it may be assumed that there is an angle of inclination of 45 degrees. in summertime the sun rises to 45 + 23 (68) defeat. it leaning toward them, and in meltersummer the sun only rises at 45-23 degrees. there is a great difference between the sun, which goes down 22 degrees and the sun 63 degrees. in summertime the Sun heats up more than anything else, and the southern one prefers to lie down.\n",

      "what is orgasam?   an orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. it is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.  in a human male orgasm, there are rapid, rhythmic contractions of the prostate, urethra and the muscles at the base of the penis, which (in the adult) typically force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. this is referred to as ejaculation. the process usually takes from 3 to 10 seconds. the process is usually, but not always, extremely pleasurable. orgasm is generally induced by direct stimulation of the penis. some men experience heightened orgasm by direct stimulation of the prostate through the perineum.  following ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs during which a man cannot have another orgasm. this period can be anywhere from less than a minute to over half a day, depending on age and other individual factors. a very few cases have been reported of men who appear to have no refractory period at all. scientists theorize that a pituitary gland disorder or difference may cause this unique ability.  in a human female orgasm, orgasm is preceded by moistening of the vaginal walls, and an enlargement of the clitoris due to increased blood flow trapped in the clitoris's spongy tissue. some women exhibit a sex flush; a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. as a woman comes closer to having orgasm, the clitoris moves inward under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (minor lips) becomes darker. as orgasm becomes imminent, the vagina decreases in size by about 30% and also becomes congested with blood. the uterus then experiences muscular contractions. a woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. the majority of women consider these contractions to be very pleasurable.  after the orgasm is over, the clitoris re-emerges from under the clitoral hood, and returns to its normal size in less than 10 minutes. unlike men, women either do not have a refractory period or have a very short one, and thus can experience a second orgasm soon after the first; some women can even follow this with a third, or even fourth orgasm; this is known as having multiple orgasms. after the initial orgasm, subsequent climaxes may be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates. research shows that about 13% of women experience multiple orgasms; a larger number may be able to experience this with the proper stimulation (such as a vibrator) and frame of mind. however, some women's clitorises are too sensitive after orgasm, making additional stimulation painful; they are probably not able to experience multiple orgasms\n",

      "titanic questions? how could an iceberg hit an unsinkable ship? why did lower classes have to wait?isn't it the crews fault for not letting them go and for almost 1,500 people dying?why didn't titanic have enough life belts and life boats?why didn't they prepare for something like this? finally, why did people want to take and sell treasures found on the titanic? shouldn't titanc's victims rest in peace? the answers to your questions in the order asked:  (1) any ship can hit an iceberg, it's not like the iceberg is living and could have moved out of the way because it wanted to.   (2) in those days, the poor were considered \"third class\" individuals, and so on the ship were put into the \"third class\" accomodations. as such, the crew was directed to make sure the first and second class passengers were attended to first. that wasn't right to do at all, but that's just how it was.   (3) it's mainly the fault of the shipbuilders who only put 20 lifeboats on the ship, which wasn't enough for half the passengers. sharing in the blame would have to be the officer who tried to turn the ship when it was too close already, since the ship wouldn't have sunk if it hit the iceberg head on. it was also the captain's fault for not taking the necessary precautions with the ship when he knew they were headed directly into an ice field.  (4) the shipbuilders wanted as much \"ooh and ahh\" over the ship as they could get from the public. that's why they fostered the belief that the ship was \"unsinkable\", and that the ship itself was one big lifeboat. those in charge also felt that the extra boats would have cluttered up the ship's deck.   (5) they didn't prepare for this because they were arrogant and felt that they had the greatest ship in all of history and nothing would ever happen to it.  (6) greed is why people tried to take and sell titanic artifacts. it was all about the $$$.   (7) titanic's victims are long-gone. either they were consumed by organisms at the bottom of the ocean, or like anyone in the grave, their bodies returned to the dust.\n",

      "why and when was the mason-dixon line completed?   though the mason-dixon line is most commonly associated with the division between the northern and southern (free and slave, respectively) states during the 1800s and american civil war-era, the line was delineated in the mid-1700s to settle a property dispute. the two surveyors who mapped the line, charles mason and jeremiah dixon, will always be known for their famous boundary.  in 1632, king charles i of england gave the first lord baltimore, george calvert, the colony of maryland. fifty years later, in 1682, king charles ii gave william penn the territory to the north, which later became pennsylvania. a year later, charles ii gave penn land on the delmarva peninsula (the peninsula that includes the eastern portion of modern maryland and all of delaware).  the description of the boundaries in the grants to calvert and penn did not match and there was a great deal of confusion as to where the boundary (supposedly along 40° north) lay. the calvert and penn families took the matter to the british court and england's chief justice declared in 1750 that the boundary between southern pennsylvania and northern maryland should lie 15 miles south of philadelphia. a decade later, the two families agreed on the compromise and set out to have the new boundary surveyed. unfortunately, colonial surveyors were no match for the difficult job and two experts from england had to be recruited.    charles mason and jeremiah dixon arrived in philadelphia in november 1763. mason was an astronomer who had worked at the royal observatory at greenwich and dixon was a renowned surveyor. the two had worked together as a team prior to their assignment to the colonies.  after arriving in philadelphia, their first task was to determine the exact absolute location of philadelphia. from there, they began to survey the north-south line that divided the delmarva peninsula into the calvert and penn properties. only after the delmarva portion of the line had been completed did the duo move to mark the east-west running line between pennsylvania and maryland.  they precisely established the point fifteen miles south of philadelphia and since the beginning of their line was west of philadelphia, they had to begin their measurement to the east of the beginning of their line. they erected a limestone benchmark at their point of origin.  travel and surveying in the rugged \"west\" was difficult and slow going. the surveyors had to deal with many different hazards, one of the most dangerous to the men being the indigenous native americans living in the region. the duo did have native american guides although once the survey team reached a point 36 miles east of the end point of the boundary, their guides told them not to travel any farther. hostile residents kept the survey from reaching its end goal. thus, on october 9, 1767, almost four years after they began their surveying, the 233 mile-long mason-dixon had (almost) been completely surveyed.  over fifty years later, the boundary between the two states came into the spotlight with the missouri compromise of 1820. the compromise established a boundary between the slave states of the south and the free states of the north (however its separation of maryland and delaware is a bit confusing since delaware was a slave state that stayed in the union). this boundary became referred to as the mason-dixon line because it began in the east along the mason-dixon line and headed westward to the ohio river and along the ohio to its mouth at the mississippi river and then west along 36° 30' north.  this line was very symbolic in the minds of the people of the young nation struggling over slavery and the names of the two surveyors who created it will evermore be associated with that struggle and its geographic association\n",

      "is interracial dating a \"real\" thing and does it really end up working out in the end? seriously, can it work out in the end-given a situation where each person comes from a completely different background. and don't answer with all the pc garbage. whats the truth here? i'll tell you what, you want a straight up answer? i'll give you one! all pc crap aside. i have been all over this planet and seen some pretty awesome things and dated some very foreign women. in the end i have learned that there is two things that make this a little more difficult than dating some one of your own class and ethniticity. 1) parents- they make life difficult on every level of this because they are usually stuck in a oneminded track of how things ought to be. usualy because thats how they were brought up. but even thats a poor excuse for their offten tired and outdated principles. most times they just have a cankering of racial bigotry in their heads just like everyone else. they usually make things twice as difficult on their dughter/son as what things already are and in the end the child will usually claim allegiance to them and their wishes. it snot fair and you cant really do much about it. this is usually the biggest reason for \"intermixed\" relationships to fail. 2) each other- you to individuals are in most cases born of two completely different worlds. in each of these worlds there are certain rules and traditions that are generally expected to be followed without question (parents usually play a role in this also). often times you two individuals get these rules and traditions crossed or confused and guess what? problems occur! whats worse, is mosot times you blame eachother for not understanding the other or you tell eachother that the other refuses to listen or learn. the fact is, both times it all depends on the want or need to make it work. it can and often times does work out, but not without a whole lot of headache and elbow grease. you want to take this person on, good, but make damn well sure they want to take you on. there is a such thing as \"slumming it\", and you will find people out there that know they are going to end up with a person of their own race and class but are interested in playing with something a little differernt for a while. more often than not, and dont take this personal, but it is usually the female that gets this idea. guys dont usually particulary care too much about and too tell you the truth, the most bigoted and hard headed people i have ever met were mothers. they can play hell on their children if they dont approve of them spending their lives with some white boy, or this black girl of yours, blah,blah,blah..its hard man, you just got to have a pair and go for it in the end if its what you want. sometimes you cant control the outcome, but you can work to make the outcome better than it would be if you just left it for what it is on ts own. thats the truth in it from how i see things. everybody is different, thats how i look at things too. nothing ever exactly works out too plan. there wil always be a glitch or hitch somewhere, just make it work for you and your other instead of getting stuck on it. if your in that relationship than you should both know that it isnt interracial, its interpersonal. you two, together, or you two falling apart. thats the best i can explain it to you.\n",

The term tsunami originates in Japanese and means port (\"tsu,\" sweetener \") and wave (\" nami, \"or т). although tsunami is kraNHS - Japanese for individuals and plural purposes - tsunamis will have more historical meaning than the plural term.\n",

      "how far do you think humans are to acheiveing light speed travel?   it is impossible to actually go at the speed of light because in the formula for time dialation (that's right velocity distorts time. the faster you go, the slower time goes for you. this effect is negligable unless you are going very close to the speed of light.) if v(velocity) were equal to c(the speed of light) you would have a zero in the denomonator. the formula is: t'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)  where t' is the time that has passed from a stationary observer, t is the time that has passed for you, sqrt means square root and ^2 means squared. as you can notice, when v is small, since c^2 is so huge, you get a miniscule decimal, and 1 minus that number is basically as small as 1.0000000000001 or something, and so time is not really affected. as v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time actuall slows down for the object moving at such velocities. this formula is correct, it is part of einstein's theory of relativity, and i have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formulas.   along with time, length contracts and mass expands by the same factor.  if you were to go close to the speed of light, your mass would increase and length would decrease. this means that the density of your body would increase more and more as you went faster and faster, and your blood eventually wouldn't be able to flow anymore and your cells would die of oxygen starvation.  not that it really matters, because to even begin witnessing this effect, you would have to be going at least 90 or 95% or so the speed of light.    now to answer your question in that is it actually physically possible to get close... considering they have particle accelerators stories high and miles long requiring tremendous amounts of energy in order to even get tiny protons and neutrons to move at such speeds, it doesn't seem like they're anywhere near accelerating something big anytime soon.  f=ma, meaning in order to get something that weighs one gram, like a paperclip to accelerate to the same degree as they do the protons, you would need about 2x10^24 times the force.  that notation just means a 2 with 24 zeros after it.  the reason for this is that that is how much more mass a paperclip has then a proton.  an actual human isn't going to get anywhere close for a very long time.\n",

      "what are the odds of a man catching hiv while having unprotected sex (oral and vaginally)? what are the odds of a man catching hiv while having unprotected sex (oral and vaginally) with a woman who is hiv positive or aids.    how do those odds change over time?  in other words, one sexual encounter versus multiple? the following numbers are old, and they're all pretty much guesswork anyway, so take them with a grain of salt.  but i venture to say most people in the field would agree with my conclusions.  according to a report by researchers norman hearst and stephen hulley in the journal of the american medical association, the odds of a heterosexual becoming infected with aids after one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse with someone in a non-high-risk group without a condom are one in 5 million. with a condom it's even safer--one in 50 million. just to put this in perspective, the chances of someone in your family getting injured next year in a bubble bath are 1 in 1.3 million (source: the odds on virtually everything, heron house, 1980). you're in much greater danger of being struck by lightning (1 in 600,000), having your house bombed (1 in 290,000), or being murdered (1 in 11,000).  the numbers get a lot worse if you engage in \"high-risk behavior\"--having sexual intercourse or sharing needles with a member of a high-risk group, e.g., a gay or bisexual male or iv drug user from a major metro area, or a hemophiliac. the chances of getting aids from one such encounter range as high as 1 in 10,000 using a condom to 1 in 1,000 unprotected. even if your partner tests negative for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), the chances of infection from a high-risk person are still relatively high--1 in 50,000 without a condom. that's because there's a 45 to 90 day window during which a newly infected person can infect others but test negative. (a few people go as long as 180 days.)  from there on out, statistically speaking, things deteriorate pretty fast. if your partner is hiv-positive, your chances of getting aids after one night are 1 in 5,000 with a condom, 1 in 500 without. have sex with an hiv-positive partner 500 times using condoms and your chances escalate to 1 in 11. skip the gift wrap and they're 2 in 3.  a couple points: these odds apply equally to men and women. although there's reason to believe male-to-female aids transmission happens more often than female-to-male, the amount of difference is unknown. also, i have to emphasize again, the numbers involve a lot of guesswork. the authors admit they could be off by a factor of ten in either direction. still, one message comes through loud and clear: by far the best thing you can do to avoid aids is to be picky about your partners. use of condoms reduces your risk by a factor of 10, sleeping only with people who test negative reduces it by a factor of 5 to 50, but avoiding high-risk partners reduces it by a factor of 5,000. (you'd also be well advised to avoid high-risk behavior, such as unprotected receptive anal sex.) asking for a resume may not be romantic, but it beats kaposi's sarcoma.\n",

(\"old kinderhook\" was a native of kinderhook, new york.)   ok became the warcry of tammany hooligans in new york while beating up their opponents. it was mentioned in newspaper stories around the country.  van buren's opponents tried to turn the phrase against him, saying that it had originated with van buren's allegedly illiterate predecessor, andrew jackson, a story that has survived to this day. they also devoted considerable energy to coming up with unflattering interpretations, e.g., \"out of kash, out of kredit, and out of klothes.\"   newspaper editors and publicists around the country delighted in coming up with even sillier interpretations-- oll killed, orfully konfused, often kontradicts, etc.--so that by the time the campaign was over the expression had taken firm root nationwide.\n",

      "todays youth and violence, why? what is friggin wrong with todays youth? drive-by's? white kids thinkin and acting like they think they are black thugs? is it \"cool\" for white kids to act like black thugs and gang criminals? again i ask what is wrong with todays youth? where the heck are their parents and dont they care? well.  this is a very subjective question.  i must say, that for many youths today, they are simple victems of their parents having to earn more money, and spend more time apart from the family in order to make ends meet.  the simple fact of the matter is that money requirments are just raising each day if not exponentially each year.  the more time the parents stay away from their children, either intentional or by necessity, the children must look to other places for guidance.  for many children, simply talking different, or behaving different is ascribed to what is 'cool' at the time.  and, what may you ask defines what is 'cool'?  well that is a social interaction between children.  what they percieve as cool for others can often be percieved as what is cool for themselves.  parents in general are concerned about making sure their children are safe, and are learning, as to how the child develops, ect, they usually leave that to the schools or the doctors; both of which don't really have the resources or time to spend to make the child into a more 'acceptable' adult.  however, the aspect of violence is often subjective in today's day and age.  many times it is just a responce to a given stimuli that the child has to face.  because of the competitive nature of our society, those children that do not 'fit in' or are of a 'minority' group tend to be faced with many challenges from those within the 'popular' or 'majority' crowds.  because of this violence is one of the main answers.  it is, after all, a base instinct that drives our need for survival.  if one is directly a threat we respond with either a flight or fight responce.  for many children, the fight responce is the primary.  the flight responce, due to the nature of today's society is considered cowardly, and is not looked upon by children of substantial age (those over 13).  because of this, violence often happens, as do fights and prejudice within the social culture of children and teenagers.  the problem here is that once it has begun, it is very difficult to change the child for the better.  mainly this is because once the stimuli has taken place, and the resonce has taken hold in the child, and the child has no other options given at the time, their brain and thought process is to work with what they are given.  in this situation it is simply the aspect of fight without any other choice.  if the child is given another choice besides fighting, or flight, but to talk, and try to disarm, then the situation is different.  but, too few parents today can see the merit of talk over fighting.  indeed, many parents are just like their children, seeing fault in many people and then training their children to behave in a similar hateful way.  religion is also not the answer to this, because many types of religions, to include christianity, teach you to be intolerant of those who are different.  after all, you must change them into what you are to make them feel needed and accepted.  as this is the case with many religions out there, the aspect of religion is not the cure all.  what can be done?  simple accountability of the parents in regards to the child's life.  if the parents take a more active stance within thier childrens life, even if they are unable to direct the time, they can at least make some sort of effor tin other ways.  if the child doesn't feel trapped, or hindered, they won't resort to violence on the average.  instead, they will resort to seeking out the aid of their peers and parents to resolve an issue.  but, who knows.  the social dogma today is to be a conforming christian.  if you are not one you are a minority.  if you are already a minority then you are 2x damned, and somtimes if you are of a minority of a minority 3x damned.    untill the social stratus changes to allow for the variances within the human society, and to allow for true freedoms, then w\n",

      "what is a nucleosome?   a nucleosome is the fundamental repeating subunit of eukaryotic dna, and is made up of dna and histone proteins. it is found in the cell nucleus in eukaryotes. all chromatin (except for that packaged in the sperm nucleus) consists of nucleosomes. nucleosomes can be seen with an electron microscope as bead-like structures along the dna.  the histones make up the central core particle of the nucleosome. the dna is wrapped around this protein complex in 1.6 turns, comprising about 145 base pairs. together with the dna linking two nucleosomes, there are about 200 bps of dna per nucleosome.  nucleosomes are involved in processes ranging from compaction of dna to transcriptional control, and appear to be major carriers of epigenetically inherited information as well. repeating nucleosomes with intervening \"linker\" dna form the 10-nm-fiber, known descriptively as \"beads on a string\", and have a packing ratio of ~6, compared to \"free\" dna (per nm length). a chain of nucleosomes can be arranged in a 30-nm-fiber, a compacted structure (thought to be a helical solenoid, a zigzag ribbon structure, a superbead, or having no regular structure) with a packing ratio of ~40. the h1 histone stabilizes this structure. beyond 30 nm fiber the structure of chromatin is poorly understood, but it is classically suggested that the 30 nm fiber is arranged into loops along a central protein scaffold to form transcriptionally active euchromatin. further compaction leads to transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.\n",

      "what's with the bermuda triangle?   the bermuda triangle is a stretch of the atlantic ocean bordered by a line from florida to the islands of bermuda, to puerto rico and then back to florida. it is one of the biggest mysteries of our time - that isn't really a mystery.  the term \"bermuda triangle\" was first used in an article written by vincent h. gaddis for argosy magazine in 1964. in the article gaddis claimed that in this strange sea a number of ships and planes had disappeared without explanation. gaddis wasn't the first one to come to this conclusion, either. as early as 1952 george x. sands, in a report in fate magazine, noted what seemed like an unusually large number of strange accidents in that region.  in 1969 john wallace spencer wrote a book called limbo of the lost specifically about the triangle and, two years later, a feature documentary on the subject, the devil's triangle, was released. these, along with the bestseller the bermuda triangle, published in 1974, permanently registered the legend of the \"hoodoo sea\" within popular culture.  several books suggested that the disappearances were due to an intelligent, technologically advanced race living in space or under the sea.  the only problem was that the mystery was more hype than reality. in 1975 a librarian at arizona state university, named larry kusche, decided to investigate the claims made by these articles and books. what he found he published in his own book entitled the bermuda triangle mystery-solved. kusche had carefully dug into records other writers had neglected. he found that many of the strange accidents were not so strange after all. often a triangle writer had noted a ship or plane had disappeared in \"calms seas\" when the record showed a raging storm had been in progress. others said ships had \"mysteriously vanished\" when their remains had actually been found and the cause of their sinking explained.  more significantly a check of lloyd's of london's accident records by the editor of fate in 1975 showed that the triangle was a no more dangerous part of the ocean than any other. u.s. coast guard records confirmed this and since that time no good arguments have ever been made to refute those statistics. so the bermuda triangle mystery disappeared, in the same way many of its supposed victims had vanished.  even though the bermuda triangle isn't a true mystery, this region of the sea certainly has had its share of marine tragedy. perhaps the best known one was the story of flight 19.  the tale of flight 19 started on december 5th, 1945. five avenger torpedo bombers lifted into the air from the navel air station at fort lauderdale, florida, at 2:10 in the afternoon. it was a routine practice mission and the flight was composed of all students except for the commander, a lt. charles taylor.  the mission called for taylor and his group of 13 men to fly due east 56 miles to hens and chicken shoals to conduct practice bombing runs. when they had completed that objective, the flight plan called for them to fly an additional 67 miles east, then turn north for 73 miles and finally straight back to base, a distance of 120 miles. this course would take them on a triangular path over the sea.  about an hour and a half after the flight had left, a lt. robert cox picked up a radio transmission from taylor. taylor indicated that his compasses were not working, but he believed himself to be somewhere over the florida keys (the keys are a long chain of islands south of the florida mainland). cox urged him to fly north, toward miami, if taylor was sure the flight was over the keys.  planes today have a number of ways that they can check their current position including listening to a set of gps (global positioning satellites) in orbit around the earth. it is almost impossible for a pilot to get lost if he has the right equipment and uses it properly. in 1945, though, planes flying over water had to depend on knowing their st\n",

      "what are the differences between the processes of fission and fusion?   the main difference that there is between fission and fusion is that fission is the splitting of an atom to form two smaller ones while fusion is the fusing of two smaller atoms to form a larger atom. in each of these the binding energy of the final product or products is higher than that of the prerequisites. this is explained more fully in the next section (binding energy).   fission itself is a nuclear process which does not usually occur naturally in nature (at least not that we know of) as it requires a large mass and an incident neutron to start the reaction. however this would not last for a long time as the reaction would explode and produce a result such as in an atomic bomb. this volatile nature is what prevents fission from occurring for any length of time naturally.   fusion on the other hand is a process which occurs quite naturally. in fact, if fusion did not occur naturally we would not be around today. this is due to stars being the result of the fusion process, the fusion of mainly light atoms into heavier atoms. fusion also releases a lot more energy in comparison to fission in relation to the mass input. put simply you will get more energy released from the fusion of 1kg of hydrogen ions than you will from fission of 1kg of uranium.\n",

(where would you be spending your money in year 2, to insure that year 3 produces the results that you need).  it's a given that your plan will be wrong (one way or another), but it's critical that you do this on paper.  6. read the e-myth.  michael gerber lays out a roadmap.  (that was a guide for our multi-million dollar start-up)  7. hire people only if you must, and then hire people smarter than you.  this is critical.  most start-ups go \"on the cheap\".  most start-ups fail.  look for people that have succeeded in starting a business.  8. put your business plan into a \"presentation\", and present it to as many influential people as possible.  amazingly most everyone is supportive of the little guy who has the guts to go out on a limb.  listen to their advice (and weigh it accordingly).  this is part \"strategic planning\" and part \"marketing\".  you are just trying to get the message out.  at the end of each presentation, ask \"do you know of anyone who i should talk to, who would be interested in my product or service?\"  get leads.  follow up on them.  9. keeping your eye on your target market and financial goals, turn down very little business down (initially) until you can meet your financial target.  price your deals based on how close to the target they are.  for instance, if you choose to perform landscaping for businesses, but someone asks you to help them with a residential job, bid the job so that it's \"worth your time\".  don't ever complain that \"this isn't my core business\".  the only business you want to avoid in the early stages are the deals that don't have a clean exit or a paying customer.  if you can state your price, and do a job, and have a satisfied customer, and make a few bucks, that is golden!  you are looking for reference accounts.  10.  when you are so busy that you have the luxury of being selective of the business that you take on, price yourself accordingly.  some business you may want to say no to.  other business you may want to price high.  remember the target set in step 2.  if it's a \"bullseye\" deal (exactly the type of business you are looking for, with a customer that will be happy and refer\n",

      "how do you recover from co-dependency? my wife has been addicted to pain killers and xanex for about seven years.  without realizing it i've become more and more co-dependent over the years, to the point that my life is pretty much in shambles (but not hopeless).  i'm a shell of the person i was seven years ago. feels like i'm just hanging on by my fingertips, and i have two boys,7 and 8, that i've pretty much raised by myself and i cannot let this go any further for their sakes. i just don't know what steps to take. getting away from her might help a lot but i've done plenty to get myself into this mess. i've become very adept at isolating myself and avoiding confronting a problem head on in hopes it will just disappear. i was never like this before. if you really want to recover from co-dependency, you need to know exactly what you're doing to encourage,  and most of all why you do it.  there are support groups for all types of co-dependency that will acquaint you with the 12 steps, as designed by alcoholic anonymous, and prior to that seven of them were actually found in the bible.  it's all about your own spirituality or lack of such.  since you know you're behaving as a co-dependent, you probably feel as you mentioned in your question, that it's easier to do it and hope it will all just disappear.  that's a childish way of thought.  nothing as serious as drug or alcohol abuse will 'just go away'.  if it were that simple, people would stop using when they found it didn't bring the joy they once hoped for.  we need to learn the steps to self-love and relinquishing control as a beginning.  you control your wife by fulfilling her need for pain-killers.  if you didn't do that, do you fear deep down that she might leave you, or at least not acknowledge you as you wish?  if you truly loved yourself, you wouldn't feel that needy because you would be happy with only yourself, if that's what the outcome would be to refusing to help your wife get what she wants.  the spiritual basis is very important.  you need to have a strong and sincere faith to be able to make the changes neccessary for a better life for your family and yourself.  please locate a narcotics anonymous or alcoholics anonymous meeting group and encourage your wife to attend.  you, on the other hand must attend the alanon or naranon meetings for your own support and information. it will widen your self-knowledge and bring you closer to your god belief. this is not a 5 minute or 5 day recovery program.  it is a lifetime committment for your wife and perhaps you as well.  their are groups for the children of addicted parents or other close family members.  there is alateen and acoa as well as naranon.  please locate alcoholics anonymous in your phone directory and call for more information.  they are more than happy to get you started on the road to peace and happiness. many blessings to you,  my opinion only\n",

      "what is fuzzy logic?   fuzzy logic is a superset of conventional (boolean) logic that has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth -- truth values between \"completely true\" and \"completely false\".  it was introduced by dr. lotfi zadeh of uc/berkeley in the 1960's as a means to model the uncertainty of natural language. (note: lotfi, not lofti, is the correct spelling of his name.)  zadeh says that rather than regarding fuzzy theory as a single theory, we should regard the process of ``fuzzification'' as a methodology to generalize any specific theory from a crisp (discrete) to a continuous (fuzzy) form (see \"extension principle\" in [2]). thus recently researchers have also introduced \"fuzzy calculus\", \"fuzzy differential equations\", and so on (see [7]).  fuzzy subsets:  just as there is a strong relationship between boolean logic and the concept of a subset, there is a similar strong relationship between fuzzy logic and fuzzy subset theory.  in classical set theory, a subset u of a set s can be defined as a mapping from the elements of s to the elements of the set {0, 1},     u: s --> {0, 1}  this mapping may be represented as a set of ordered pairs, with exactly one ordered pair present for each element of s. the first element of the ordered pair is an element of the set s, and the second element is an element of the set {0, 1}.  the value zero is used to represent non-membership, and the value one is used to represent membership.  the truth or falsity of the statement      x is in u  is determined by finding the ordered pair whose first element is x.  the statement is true if the second element of the ordered pair is 1, and the statement is false if it is 0.  similarly, a fuzzy subset f of a set s can be defined as a set of ordered pairs, each with the first element from s, and the second element from the interval [0,1], with exactly one ordered pair present for each element of s. this defines a mapping between elements of the set s and values in the interval [0,1].  the value zero is used to represent complete non-membership, the value one is used to represent complete membership, and values in between are used to represent intermediate degrees of membership.  the set s is referred to as the universe of discourse for the fuzzy subset f.  frequently, the mapping is described as a function, the membership function of f. the degree to which the statement      x is in f  is true is determined by finding the ordered pair whose first element is x.  the degree of truth of the statement is the second element of the ordered pair.  in practice, the terms \"membership function\" and fuzzy subset get used interchangeably.  that's a lot of mathematical baggage, so here's an example.  let's talk about people and \"tallness\".  in this case the set s (the universe of discourse) is the set of people.  let's define a fuzzy subset tall, which will answer the question \"to what degree is person x tall?\" zadeh describes tall as a linguistic variable, which represents our cognitive category of \"tallness\". to each person in the universe of discourse, we have to assign a degree of membership in the fuzzy subset tall.  the easiest way to do this is with a membership function based on the person's height.      tall(x) = { 0,                     if height(x) < 5 ft.,                 (height(x)-5ft.)/2ft., if 5 ft. <= height (x)  7 ft. }  a graph of this looks like:  1.0 +                   +-------------------     |                  /     |                 / 0.5 +                /     |               /     |              / 0.0 +-------------+-----+-------------------                   |     |                  5.0   7.0                  height, ft. ->  given this definition, here a\n",

      "magnetism vs seeds? does magnetism affect the growth of plants? please, i need you to answer this by the 10:30 magnetism in agriculture  the influence of the geomagnetic field on the growth of plants was scientifically established for the first time in 1862 by the french chemist louis pasteur (1822-1985), during his experiments on fermentation, when he discovered that the earthís magnetic field had a stimulating effect on that process.  the late dr. albert roy davies, the father of modern bio-magnetics (and the mentor of our peter kulish, the american inventor of the presented magnetizer), received a patent in 1950 for magnetically treating seeds to stimulate plant growth. use of magnets in agriculture is not new and the leading role in this respect goes to the country of israel. scientists from the mineral engineering dept. of the renown and prestigious israel institute of technology \"technion\" in haifa confirm that the principle of magneto-hydro-dynamics (mhd) permits to lower the surface tension of water, causing the increased solubility and penetration, which stimulates the roots growth.  the magnetizer has opened a new chapter in the efficient use of magnetism in agriculture.  the explanation of the principles of its working follows below.  the lowered surface tension by the monopolar magnetizer system facilitates water absorption into soil and increases solubility. this effect can be seen in case of limited cilia growth. water treated with the magnetizer de-clogs and breaks up the compressed soil giving the root cilia freedom to absorb water and minerals more quickly and by a larger surface area - in consequence obtaining major growth of roots and plants. also now the minerals pass easier through water into the roots. third, and equally important are the electromotive forces that are transferred from water to the plant. these forces, as shown in thousands of experiments and real life applications, specially stimulate the    growth activity. the root system excited by the electromotive forces of the magnetizer promotes healthier, bigger and quicker plant growth. in drip irrigation, the mineral/scale barrier known as the bowl effect, is dissolved thereby enabling and encouraging the root cilia to grow and expand further into the soil.\n",

      "what are hanukkah and kwanzaa?   chanukkah, the jewish festival of rededication, also known as the festival of lights, is an eight day festival beginning on the 25th day of the jewish month of kislev.   chanukkah is probably one of the best known jewish holidays, not because of any great religious significance, but because of its proximity to christmas. many non-jews (and even many assimilated jews!) think of this holiday as the jewish christmas, adopting many of the christmas customs, such as elaborate gift-giving and decoration. it is bitterly ironic that this holiday, which has its roots in a revolution against assimilation and the suppression of jewish religion, has become the most assimilated, secular holiday on our calendar.   the story  the story of chanukkah begins in the reign of alexander the great. alexander conquered syria, egypt and palestine, but allowed the lands under his control to continue observing their own religions and retain a certain degree of autonomy. under this relatively benevolent rule, many jews assimilated much of hellenistic culture, adopting the language, the customs and the dress of the greeks, in much the same way that jews in america today blend into the secular american society.   more than a century later, a successor of alexander, antiochus iv was in control of the region. he began to oppress the jews severely, placing a hellenistic priest in the temple, massacring jews, prohibiting the practice of the jewish religion, and desecrating the temple by requiring the sacrifice of pigs (a non-kosher animal) on the altar. two groups opposed antiochus: a basically nationalistic group led by mattathias the hasmonean and his son judah maccabee, and a religious traditionalist group known as the chasidim, the forerunners of the pharisees (no direct connection to the modern movement known as chasidism). they joined forces in a revolt against both the assimilation of the hellenistic jews and oppression by the selucid greek government. the revolution succeeded and the temple was rededicated.   according to tradition as recorded in the talmud, at the time of the rededication, there was very little oil left that had not been defiled by the greeks. oil was needed for the menorah (candelabrum) in the temple, which was supposed to burn throughout the night every night. there was only enough oil to burn for one day, yet miraculously, it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of oil for the menorah. an eight day festival was declared to commemorate this miracle. note that the holiday commemorates the miracle of the oil, not the military victory: jews do not glorify war.       definition of kwanzaa kwanzaa is a unique african american celebration with focus on the traditional african values of family, community responsibility, commerce, and self-improvement. kwanzaa is neither political nor religious and despite some misconceptions, is not a substitute for christmas. it is simply a time of reaffirming african-american people, their ancestors and culture. kwanzaa, which means \"first fruits of the harvest\" in the african language kiswahili, has gained tremendous acceptance. since its founding in 1966 by dr. maulana karenga, kwanzaa has come to be observed by more than18 million people worldwide, as reported by the new york times. when establishing kwanzaa in 1966, dr. karenga included an additional \"a\" to the end of the spelling to reflect the difference between the african american celebration (kwanzaa) and the motherland spelling (kwanza).  kwanzaa is based on the nguzo saba (seven guiding principles), one for each day of the observance, and is celebrated from december 26th to january 1st.   umoja (oo-mo-jah) unity stresses the importance of togetherness for the family and the community, which is reflected in the african saying, \"i am we,\" or \"i am because we are.\"  kujichagulia (koo-gee-cha-goo-lee-yah) self-determination requires that we define our common in\n",

      "is the flashlight beam traveling faster than the speed of light? traveling in a car at the speed of light, you shine a flashlight toward a car in front of you also travelling at the speed of light. does the flashlight beam reach the car ahead? if so, what speed is the flashlight beam traveling? well first, read my other answer to your question about the speed of sound.  you would probably expect the answer to be the same, and the light to reach the other car, but this is a special circumstance because nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, not even light itself.  when a beam of light is shone ahead of a rapidly moving space vehicle, and is expected to be moving at the speed of light plus the speed of the vehicle, it is still only moving at the speed of light, which is puzzling.  physicists have defined the speed of light to be the ultimate cutoff point for speed.  and also, you wouldn't be able to travel at the speed of light anyway because time would probably stop since it does get slower and slower the faster you go.  velocity warps time, the faster you go, the slower time moves for you relative to a stationary object.  i've read this, and it is definately true, we had to derive the formula in physics from, and calculate the time, lenghth(which decreases with speed), and mass (which increases with speed) distortion as well.  the effects of this are very negligable unless you are moving at speeds very very close to the speed of light, at least over 90% of the speed of light, and we haven't gotten anywhere close yet.  the denominator of this factor that time, length, and mass are distorted by actually is 1 minus the square root of the speed of light(c) over the speed in which the object is traveling (v), so the reason you can't go faster than the speed of light is because if v was greater than c, then that square root would be greater than one, meaning the denominator would be negative, meaning the factor would be negative, and the light would actually be travelling backwards in time...  if you find any of this interesting, i highly recommend \"the elegant universe\" by brian greene.\n",

Test the strength from Jason windows to show that there are little or no starch in the non-green areas and much strength in the green area. This may not be working for all leaves because some plants do not gather starch in their leaves but export photosynthates as liquids. 2. Extract chlorine from green and non green areas to show that the non-green areas have little or no chlorophyll. Just because a leaf is not green will mean that there is no chlorophyll.\n",
